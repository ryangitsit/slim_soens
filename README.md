# The *Slim* Simulator for Superconducting Optoelectronic Networks
![plot](./img/emblem_large.png)
Superconducting Optoelectronic Networks (SOENs) are an in-development neuromorphic hardware that offer *lightspeed communication* and *brain-level scalability*.\
This repo is for the coders, neuroscientists, and machine-learners that want to play with the computational properties of SOENs through simulations, based on the phenomological model linked here:
 - https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09976

For the interested hardware afficianados and device physicists, explanatory materical can be found:

Enjoy!

## Getting Started
 - Clone this repo
   - `git clone https://github.com/ryangitsit/sim_soens.git` 
 - Be sure to have the necessary python packages with the following commands (setup for python v3.10 -- may have to manually add packages otherwise)
   - `pip install -r requirements.txt` 
 - Open `tutorials/overview.ipynb` for a simulator walkthrough 
   - How to use jupyter notebooks: https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/
   - Or just use the jupyter extension in the vscode IDE
 - Read the docs!
